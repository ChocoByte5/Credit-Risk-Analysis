# Credit-Risk-Analysis
Machine Learning model for predicting loan approval based on financial data.

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict loan approval based on financial data using Machine Learning. It utilizes **Decision Trees** and **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize the accuracy of predictions.

# Features
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and importance analysis
- Decision Tree model with hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and visualization

# Files in this repository
- `credit_risk_analysis_dt_tuning.py` â†’ Python script for training and tuning the Decision Tree model.
- `credit_risk_analysis_DT_Tuning.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook with code, analysis, and explanations.
- `credit_risk_model.pkl` â†’ Trained Decision Tree model saved for future use.
  
# Results
The final Decision Tree model achieved ***91% accuracy***, balancing performance and generalization.

# Next Steps
Test **Random Forest** or **Gradient Boosting** for improved performance  
Apply **feature selection techniques** to enhance model efficiency 

**Loan Approval Classification Data** (used for credit risk analysis)

# How to Use the Model
**Install required libraries** (if not already installed): 
```bash
pip install joblib pandas numpy scikit-learn

**Load the trained model:
import joblib
model = joblib.load("credit_risk_model.pkl")
print("Model loaded successfully!")

**Make predictions (example):
import numpy as np
sample_data = np.array([[50000, 12000, 15.0, 5, 700, 1, 30, 1, 0.3, 2]])  
prediction = model.predict(sample_data)
print("Predicted Loan Approval:", prediction)
